# MaxShot
A Python script to automatically screenshot an area of your screen when it changes.

Now you can capture Zoom presentation slides automatically!

    git clone

<br>

    cd MaxShot

<br>

    pip install -r requirements.txt

<br>

    python MaxShot.py


<br>

#### Option 2: Download a pre-compiled .exe file

This option is currently under development.

<br>

## Step 2: How to Use

1. Run the python file

2. A window with a screenshot of the current screen will open. Click and drag your mouse over the portion of your screen you would like your program to moniter.

3. Enjoy your meeting! Slides in the selected zone will be automatically captured, cropped, and saved to a folder in the starting directory.

4. When you are done with your meeting, interrupt the program.
